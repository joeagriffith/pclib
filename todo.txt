- Compare hardcoded grad calculations vs backward()

- Lateral inhibition inspired by Hawkins' Hierarchical Temporal Memory

- Dropout on each and both X, E nodes

- Noise X nodes (also?), not just E nodes

- Deffine a robust metric for measuring Sparsity and Interlayer Correlations. measure change in these metrics when using Lateral Inhibition.

- Fix Initialisations. E graphs have wierd spike at start
