reducing timescale for higher layers by either reducing forward propagated error size (if corrective) or reducing gamma.
- Either reduce forward propagated error magnitude (if corrective) or reduce gamma
- Not beneficial for static inference (probably)

r update is better without update *= d_actv_fn(r)
- why?

top-down predictions of variances aswell as means
- precision weighted bottom-up error signals
- trained to minimise same VFE
- would need some learning rule for variances, or use backprop

Can PC/ActInf be used to show the phenomena of objects staying still in vision as during active movement, 
but moving as a result of external pertubation to vision?
- Build an organism which can look around, and encode its visual field.
- Build a decoder for what the organisms is looking at.
- Compare minor movements in head to external pertubations, and see result in decoder
- Is there a difference in decoded data between the two pertubation types?
