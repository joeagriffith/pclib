reducing timescale for higher layers by either reducing forward propagated error size (if corrective) or reducing gamma.
- Either reduce forward propagated error magnitude (if corrective) or reduce gamma
- Not beneficial for static inference (probably)

r update is better without update *= d_actv_fn(r)
- why?
